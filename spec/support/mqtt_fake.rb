# It behaves in the following ways:
#   * Responses to CONNECT with a successful CONACK
#   * Responses to PUBLISH by echoing the packet back
#   * Responses to SUBSCRIBE with SUBACK and a PUBLISH to the topic
#   * Responses to PINGREQ with PINGRESP
#   * Responses to DISCONNECT by closing the socket
#
# It has the following restrictions
#   * Doesn't deal with timeouts
#   * Only handles a single connection at a time
